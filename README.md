# Web-browser-1.4-Beta-4-Forkshaft-4
My web browser. Created way bank in 2013 when I was not even a teenager... and well I guess this serves as a memory of my experiments back then. 

Used the Gecko and Trident (Internet Explorer) engines. Supported a (decent?) range of features, along with some which would never be in a browser.
